# API key Best Practice
  - Use a instance role whenever possible 
 - Don't use your normal user account 
 - Limit permissions as tight as possible 
 - Rotate API keys regularly 
 - Never put API keys in code or store in a publically accessible location 
 - Different keys for different applications
